/* In the mathematical theory of directed graphs, a graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other 
vertex. The strongly connected components of an arbitrary directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly 
connected. It is possible to test the strong connectivity of a graph, or to find its strongly connected components, in linear time 
(that is, Î˜(V + E)). */

//Kosaraju's Algorithm
/* Makes use of the fact that the transpose graph (the same graph with the direction of every edge reversed) has exactly the same strongly
connected components as the original graph. */

//Intuition: If we smartly do dfs in reverse order, we will find components
/* 
1. Sort all nodes in order of finishing time using Stack (Toposort)
2. Transpose the graph (Reverse all the edges)
3. DFS according to finishing TIME

TC = O(N + E) + O(N + E) 
SC = O(N + E) + O(N) + O(N)
